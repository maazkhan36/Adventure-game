## ðŸŽ® How to Play

- The game starts by asking your name and welcoming you.
- You're placed on a dirt road and must make a series of choices:
  - Go left or right?
  - Swim across a river or walk around?
  - Cross a wobbly bridge or go back?
  - Talk to a stranger or not?

Each choice leads to a different ending.  
Make the right choices to win the game!
